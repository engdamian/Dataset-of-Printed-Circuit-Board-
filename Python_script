# This Python script is designed to extract a ZIP file that contains YOLO annotation files, and then create new .txt files with the same annotation content in a separate folder.
# It performs three main actions:
#   - Unzips the dataset into a working directory.
#   - Finds all YOLO annotation files (the .txt files that describe bounding boxes).
#   - Copies their content into new .txt files with the same names, saved in a clean output folder.
# The result is a set of readable annotation files, ready for further use or processing, without modifying the original data.

# === CONFIGURATION ===
zip_file_path = 'PCB_annotaions_1_YOLO_detection.zip'  # Your input YOLO zip file

# === STEP 1: Extract the ZIP ===
os.makedirs(extraction_path, exist_ok=True)

# === STEP 2: Read and copy YOLO annotations ===

            output_file_path = os.path.join(output_path, file)

            with open(input_file_path, 'r') as infile, open(output_file_path, 'w') as outfile:
                for line in infile:
                    outfile.write(line.strip() + '\n')
